## Community

### Discussions
Come on [gitter](https://gitter.im/andypetrella/spark-notebook?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)!
Helpful and friendly community around the Spark Notebook, ready to provide help and advice on setting up and working with the Spark Notebook. Our core committers hang often on Gitter. 

### Mailing list
There are two different mailing lists, each aiming to specific discussions:

#### Spark Notebook Dev

The [spark-notebook-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fr#!forum/spark-notebook-dev) mailing list for all threads regarding implementation, architecture, features and what not related to fix or enhance the project.

#### Spark Notebook User

The [spark-notebook-user](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fr#!forum/spark-notebook-user) is for almost everything else than dev, which are questions, bugs, complains, or hopefully some kindness :-D.
