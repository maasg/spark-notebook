## Quick Start Guide

Start using the Spark Notebook in less than 5 minutes? Take these steps:

### Requirements:
* Make sure you are running at least Java 7 

### Steps
* Go to [spark-notebook.io](http://spark-notebook.io/)
	* Choose your release, spark version and additional packages according to your specific needs
		- Read more on: [Using Releases](using_releases.md)
	* If trying Spark for the first time, pick the latest release
* Download one of the packaged builds (TGZ or ZIP)
* Extract the file somewhere convenient
* Open a terminal/command window
* Change to the root directory of the expanded distribution
* Execute the command `bin/spark-notebook` (*NIX) or `bin\spark-notebook` (Windows)
* Open your browser to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

This procedure will launch a Notebook Server with the default configuration. If all went well, you will see the Notebook browser home page:
