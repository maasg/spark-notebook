#Clusters

The basic idea is to configure a **template** that will act as a factory for notebooks:
![Clusters](https://raw.github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook/master/images/clusters.png)

Then you'll have to fill some informations as Json, where you'll have to give a `name` and specify a `profile`.
